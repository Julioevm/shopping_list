# Web Shopping List App

This is a little project I'm doing for learning purposes. A Shopping list application using TDD for vanilla Javascript.

To run this, simply start a local http server from the project root folder, like:

`python3 -m http.server`

Using [semantic-ui](https://semantic-ui.com/) for the style.

To check the tests go to 'localhost_url:port/test/specrunner.html'
